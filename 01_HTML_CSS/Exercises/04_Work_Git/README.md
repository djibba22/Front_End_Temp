# 📖 Create a New GitHub Repository

Work with a partner to implement the following Goal:

*  I want to create a new GitHub repository and add an HTML file to it.  

## Solution

* It's done when I have created a new repository named `split-stack-demo` using the GitHub user interface.

* It's done when I have cloned the `split-stack-demo` to my local machine.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to navigate into the `split-stack-demo` directory.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to create an `index.html` file.

* It's done when I add and commit my changes using Git commands.

* It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository.
