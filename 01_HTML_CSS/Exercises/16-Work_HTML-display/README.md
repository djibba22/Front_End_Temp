# 🐛 Names and Dragons Are Not Displaying Correctly

Work with others to resolve the following issues:

* Users should be able to see a horizontal navigation bar with three Names side-by-side.

* Users should be able to see three Dragons.

* Users should be able to see the Dragons centered and stacked on top of each other.

## Expected Behavior

* All three list items in the navigation bar should display inline.

* All three Dragons should be visible. 

* Each Dragon should appear centered and on its own line.

## Actual Behavior

* Each Name in the navigation bar displays on its own line.

* Two Dragons are visible, and one is not displayed.

* The two visible Dragons display inline and aligned to the left. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
