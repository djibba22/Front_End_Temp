# 📖 Goal
## Use only terminal Commands to create a project

# Problem
Work with a partner to implement the following :

* As a developer, I want to use only the terminal to engineer software. 
* As a developer, I want to use only the terminal to create directories, files and navigate my PC. 

# Solution

* It's done when a new directory named `software_developement` has been created using only command-line commands.

* It's done when the `software_development` directory contains a file named `index.html`. The file should also be created using command-line commands.
