# üèóÔ∏è Create a Webpage About the UCF Knight Mascot

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a fan of UCF, I want to create a webpage that highlights the UCF Knight mascot, including an image, a description, and contact information.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the main header reads "UCF Knight Mascot".

* It's done when there is a section that includes the mascot's name, an image, and a paragraph describing the mascot.

* It's done when there is a second section that includes a subheader labeled "Contact Info" and a list that includes links to the mascot's email, Instagram, and the official UCF website.

* It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.
